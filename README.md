Welcome to my project!
I am learning how to organize things in MVC, so the code here is starting to reflect that hopefully.  

Please keep in mind if using this that THE PASSWORDS ARE NOT HASHED. I'm learning Node.js and am uploading code as I learn things, and obviously the next step is to hash the password so that they are not plain text, but for now this is what I have. Feel free to make a pull request as well.  

Enjoy the project! Thank you for coming!
